# History
The SAYNÈTES story began around 2011. It was born out of the technical needs felt when setting up amateur live shows.
At first, the software only managed audio, then the possibility of renting DMX lighting equipment at low cost presented itself, and it evolved to support this protocol, at first in a rudimentary way. Needs guided its evolution.
This version of Saynètes has been completely rewritten by the author, who is passionate about programming.
