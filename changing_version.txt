This file is a memento for the developper.

For each RELEASE published on GitHub, increase the version doing the following:
1) local dev branch: change version in a) in project options in Lazarus IDE
                                       b) in u_common.pas
                                       c) in ReleaseTools\win\innosetup script 64
                                       d) in file "version"
2) local dev branch: execute ReleaseTools/scripts to produce the binaries release for each supported platform.
3) local dev branch: commit, push and publish the change to Github master branch.
4) GitHub: create a new release with the new tag (version) and drag in the binaries release.
